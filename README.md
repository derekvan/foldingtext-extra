# FoldingText Extensions

Extensions, scripts, themes for [FoldingText 2.0 and TaskPaper 3.0](http://support.foldingtext.com/discussions/development-versions). Each plugin is described in its own README file (inside each plugin folder).

To install a plugin, drag its `.ftplugin` folder into your FoldingText or TaskPaper `Plug-Ins` folder. Open this folder from within FoldingText or TaskPaper with the menu command `File > Open Application Folder`. The plugin will then be loaded in all subsequently-opened files (close a file and reopen it to load the plugin).
